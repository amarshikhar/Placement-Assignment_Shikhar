        "Ans. A correlation coefficient of 0.7 indicates a strong positive relationship between SAT scores and college GPA. This means that as SAT scores increase, college GPA tends to increase as well. The magnitude of the correlation coefficient, which ranges from -1 to 1, indicates the strength of the relationship. A value of 0.7 suggests a relatively strong correlation.\n",

While a strong positive correlation between SAT scores and college GPA suggests that higher SAT scores are associated with higher college GPAs, it does not necessarily mean that SAT scores directly cause higher GPAs. There may be other factors, such as study habits, motivation, or other abilities, that contribute to academic success in college."

Since the dataset is approximately normally distributed, we can use the empirical rule, also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule.\n",

The mean of the sample mean height will be the same as the population mean, which is 170 cm.
